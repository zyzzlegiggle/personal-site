        <h1>2025</h1>
        <p>I joined several hackathons this year and tried building fast prototypes.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://lunchpot.site/">Lunchpot</a> —  
            simple app where you can find recommended food near you with one click of a button.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/zyzzlegiggle/storyblok-cli-ai">Storyblok CLI-AI</a> —  
            a scaffolder where you describe the app you want, and it generates the project
            and integrates Storyblok (hackathon).
          </li>

          <li>
            <a href="https://pathwise-one.vercel.app/">Pathwise</a> —  
            checks possible careers based on your resume (hackathon).
          </li>

          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/zyzzlegiggle/form-filler-survey">Form Filler</a> —  
            made this because I couldn’t find a good Google Form autofiller.  
            This version is tailored to my own survey.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>2024</h1>
        <p>The year I first got into programming seriously and started internships.</p>

        <p>
          During internship work, I explored Angular, Express, ESP32, and some ROS2 robotics tasks.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/zyzzlegiggle/spice">Spice</a> —  
            one of my earliest web projects, written with PHP.
          </li>

          <li>
            <a href="https.github.com/zyzzlegiggle/Chess">Chess</a> —  
            built with C++ and SFML.  
            This was my first full program made completely on my own without guides.
          </li>

          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/zyzzlegiggle/Crazy8">Crazy8</a> —  
            another early C++ project while learning fundamentals.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>2023</h1>
        <p>The very first year I touched coding and built anything at all.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://weather50.netlify.app/">Weather50</a> —  
            my first program ever, built using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
            A simple weather app that kicked off everything.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </>
